					<!--Concept of the website-->
					<h3>My name is Preston DeMarco, and I am currently a junior at Marist College. I am studying Games and 
					Emerging Media with a concentration in Technical Development and Programming. My goals in life consist of joining 
					a relatively known video game developing studio after I finish my time at college.  The desired job I would like to 
					have would be a programmer for the studio.  My next big goal in life would be to start up my own video game company.  
					It would be an amazing experience to own my own company and make up my own rules for how it runs. With these goals set 
					in place, this will hopefully lead to a happy and healthy lifestyle for rest of my life. I have always had a personal 
					connection with video games starting at a very young age. <br><br>My earliest memories as a kid were playing Mario Kart 64, 
					Super Mario 64, etc. on the Nintendo 64 at my grandparent's house with my cousins.  It is these memories that have stuck 
					with me over the years and have created my interest with them. Video games have been an integral part of my life and wish 
					to further develop my career in this type of field.  Over the past few years, I have taken a passion for programming and 
					figured I could combine the two and make a successful career out of it. I have this long-standing dream of mine since I was 
					a sophomore in high school to become a video game programmer and wish to turn this dream into a reality.
